<objective>
Create the `/order` route with page layout, hero section, and navigation integration.

Purpose: Establish the order page structure that will host the board size selector and order form in subsequent phases.
Output: Working `/order` route accessible from navigation with hero section and placeholder content area.

**Codebase patterns:**
@.planning/codebase/CONVENTIONS.md
@.planning/codebase/STRUCTURE.md

**Reference implementations:**
@src/app/b2b/page.tsx - Similar page structure to follow
@src/app/page.tsx - Home page composition pattern
@src/content/nav.ts - Navigation structure

**Key patterns from codebase:**
- Pages export metadata for SEO
- Pages use `container mx-auto px-4` for layout
- Hero sections use gradient backgrounds
- shadcn/ui components for cards, buttons, badges
- Font variables: `--font-script`, `--font-display`, `--font-heading`
- Theme colors: `candy-pink`, `deep-berry`, `cream`

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create order page with metadata and hero section</name>
  <files>src/app/order/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create the order page following the b2b page pattern:

1. Export metadata with:
   - title: "Order Chocolate Boards"
   - description: Focus on ordering chocolate charcuterie boards
   - keywords: order, chocolate boards, custom candy
   - openGraph with title and description

2. Create OrderPage component with:
   - Hero section with gradient background (`bg-gradient-to-br from-primary/5 to-secondary/5 py-20`)
   - Badge: "Order Now"
   - Heading: "Create Your Perfect Chocolate Board" (using font-display)
   - Subtext explaining the ordering process
   - Container div with placeholder text: "Order form coming soon" - this is where Phase 2 and 3 will add the size selector and form

3. Include SiteHeader and SiteFooter components for consistent navigation

Use existing patterns from b2b/page.tsx. Keep it simple - just the page shell with hero.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `npm run build` passes without errors
    - Visit http://localhost:3000/order shows the page with hero section
    - Page has proper metadata (check page title in browser tab)
  </verify>
  <done>
    - Order page renders at /order route
    - Hero section displays with title and description
    - SiteHeader and SiteFooter present
    - No TypeScript or build errors
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add Order link to site navigation</name>
  <files>src/content/nav.ts, src/components/site-header.tsx</files>
  <action>
1. In src/content/nav.ts:
   - Add "Order" item to the main navigation array
   - href: "/order"
   - description: "Order chocolate charcuterie boards"
   - Position: After "Candy Boards" (index 3) or before "Contact"

2. In src/components/site-header.tsx:
   - Verify the navigation renders from nav.ts (it should already)
   - If Order link doesn't appear, check how navigation items are mapped
   - The header should pick up the new nav item automatically

Note: The header likely already maps over navigation.main, so adding to nav.ts should be sufficient.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `npm run build` passes
    - Navigation shows "Order" link in header
    - Clicking "Order" navigates to /order page
  </verify>
  <done>
    - "Order" link visible in site header navigation
    - Link navigates to /order route
    - Navigation order is logical (Order appears near Candy Boards)
  </done>
</task>

Before declaring phase complete:
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds without errors
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes
- [ ] /order route is accessible and renders correctly
- [ ] Navigation includes Order link
- [ ] Page is visually consistent with rest of site (uses same header/footer)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All tasks completed
- All verification checks pass
- No TypeScript errors or warnings
- Order page accessible at /order with hero section
- Navigation updated to include Order link
- Page ready for Phase 2 to add board size selector
