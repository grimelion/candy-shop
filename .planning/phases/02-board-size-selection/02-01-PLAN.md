**Prior phase context:**
@.planning/phases/01-order-page-structure/01-01-SUMMARY.md

**Codebase patterns:**
@.planning/codebase/CONVENTIONS.md

**Reference implementations:**
@src/components/pricing-cards.tsx - Has board size data and card styling patterns
@src/app/order/page.tsx - Current order page with placeholder to replace

**Key patterns from codebase:**
- "use client" for interactive components
- kebab-case file names for components
- PricingCard pattern with features list, price display
- Theme colors: candy-pink, deep-berry, cream
- Font variables: --font-heading, --font-display
- shadcn/ui Card components available

**Board size data from pricing-cards.tsx:**
- Small: $45, serves 2-4, "Sweet Treats"
- Medium: $85, serves 6-10, "Celebration Board" (popular)
- Large: $150, serves 12+, "Grand Feast"
</context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create BoardSizeSelector component</name>
  <files>src/components/board-size-selector.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create an interactive client component for selecting board sizes:

1. Add "use client" directive (component needs onClick state)

2. Define BoardSize type and data:
   - id: "small" | "medium" | "large"
   - name: "Sweet Treats" | "Celebration Board" | "Grand Feast"
   - price: "$45" | "$85" | "$150"
   - serves: "2-4 people" | "6-10 people" | "12+ people"
   - description: Brief description
   - popular: boolean (true for medium)

3. Component props:
   - selectedSize: string | null
   - onSizeSelect: (size: string) => void

4. Render 3 cards in a responsive grid (md:grid-cols-3):
   - Each card shows: name, price, serves, description
   - Popular card has "Most Popular" badge
   - Selected card has visual highlight (ring-2 ring-candy-pink or similar)
   - Cards are clickable (cursor-pointer, hover effects)
   - Use existing color scheme (deep-berry, candy-pink, cream)

5. Style following pricing-cards pattern but simplified for selection:
   - Clean card design with border
   - Price prominent
   - Checkmark or selection indicator when selected

Note: Use shadcn/ui Card or custom divs following existing patterns. Keep it simple - this is a selector, not full pricing display.

    - File exists at src/components/board-size-selector.tsx
    - No TypeScript errors: `npx tsc --noEmit`
    - Component exports BoardSizeSelector function
  </verify>
  <done>
    - BoardSizeSelector component created with 3 size options
    - Component accepts selectedSize and onSizeSelect props
    - Cards are visually distinct with selection state
    - Follows existing codebase conventions
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Integrate BoardSizeSelector into order page</name>
  <files>src/app/order/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
1. The order page needs to manage selection state, so create a client wrapper:
   - Create a new client component OrderContent that wraps the interactive parts
   - Or make the entire page client-side (simpler for now, metadata still works)

2. Simpler approach - create OrderFormSection client component:
   - Add "use client"
   - Contains BoardSizeSelector + placeholder for form (Phase 3)
   - Manages selectedSize state with useState
   - Import and render BoardSizeSelector with state

3. Update src/app/order/page.tsx:
   - Keep as Server Component with metadata
   - Import OrderFormSection
   - Replace the placeholder div with OrderFormSection component

4. Create src/components/order-form-section.tsx:
   - "use client"
   - useState for selectedSize
   - Render section wrapper with heading
   - Render BoardSizeSelector with state management
   - Below selector, show "Continue to order form" or similar (Phase 3 placeholder)

This keeps the page as Server Component while having interactive client child.

    - `npm run build` passes without errors
    - Visit http://localhost:3000/order shows size selector cards
    - Clicking a card visually selects it
    - Selection state persists while on page
  </verify>
  <done>
    - Order page renders BoardSizeSelector instead of placeholder
    - Size selection is interactive and shows selected state
    - Page maintains SEO metadata as Server Component
    - Ready for Phase 3 to add form fields
  </done>

Before declaring phase complete:
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds without errors
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes on new files
- [ ] /order route shows 3 clickable size cards
- [ ] Clicking a size card shows selection visually
- [ ] Medium size shows "Most Popular" badge
- [ ] Responsive: cards stack on mobile, 3-column on desktop

<success_criteria>
- All tasks completed
- All verification checks pass
- No TypeScript errors
- BoardSizeSelector component created and functional
- Order page displays interactive size selection
- Ready for Phase 3 to add order form below selector
