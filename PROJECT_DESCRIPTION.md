# Googahlini’s Candy Land

## About Us

Googahlini’s Candy Land is a family-owned candy shop in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania. We opened in October 2024. We aim to bring joy through sweets — whether it’s childhood nostalgia, new flavor discoveries, or a custom candy gift for a loved one. We believe every visit should feel like a treat.

We offer:

- Classic candies and penny-candies
- Artisanal sweets from local and international makers
- Chocolate charcuterie boards for parties and events
- Custom candy favors and themed gift baskets
- Candy gifts & curated assortments for occasions

Our shop is warm, welcoming, playful. We put thought into every selection, every presentation. It's not just candy — it’s memory, connection, shared delight.
