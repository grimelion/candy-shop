**Typography**

- Headings (H1, H2): Bold serif or elegant display font — conveys craftsmanship, indulgence.
- Body / Paragraphs: Clean sans serif; readable, friendly.
- Accent Text (quotes/testimonials): Cursive or hand-lettered style sparingly to evoke nostalgia / handcrafted feel.

## Imagery & Graphics

- Use real photography of the shop, candy boards, products: texture, sparkle, color.
- Include macro shots: sugar crystals, chocolate drips, candy wrappers. Sensory appeal.
- Use custom icons / illustrations: candy wrappers, jars, boards to enhance sections.
- Natural lighting preferred; avoid harsh white lighting. Warm tones.
- Incorporate décor shots (inside shop) to show ambiance, feel of store environment.

## Layout & UX Tone

- Layout should feel inviting, not cluttered: white space, predictable patterns.
- Use visual hierarchy: highlight signature offerings (e.g. “Custom Boards,” “Gift Baskets,” “Candy Bar Events”).
- Clear calls to action (CTA): “Order Custom Board,” “Visit Us,” “Start Your Basket.”
- Feature reviews/testimonials prominently — helps build trust and warmth.

## Messaging Examples

- “Rediscover your childhood favorites — one sugary bite at a time.”
- “Hand-crafted candy boards & gift baskets made local.”
- “Sweet moments, custom favors, and boards built just for you.”
- “Party? Celebrate? Treat yourself — we’ve got your candy solution.”

## Brand Application

- Use signature color + type consistently on packaging, gift baskets, business cards.
- Signage and store print should match the digital branding (colors, fonts).
- Social media posts should use consistent filters or photo style (warm, natural, playful).
- Product tags / labels should blend vintage candy charm with sophisticated presentation for boards & baskets.

## Do’s vs Don’ts

| Do                                          | Don’t                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Use warm tones & textures                   | Use flat, cold, overly generic color blocks only                   |
| Show real product & shop interior images    | Rely solely on stock candy images or placeholders                  |
| Inject personality in wording               | Use bland, generic candy shop copy (“We have all kinds of sweets”) |
| Make customization & local identity visible | Hide the business’s roots or its uniqueness                        |
| Maintain consistency (colors, fonts, voice) | Jump between styles or voices across pages/social                  |
